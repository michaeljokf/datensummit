Welcome to the OK Lab Gießen. Our goal is to implement  exciting projects to improve the central Hessen region. Anyone who is interested in open data or civic tech is cordially invited. A variety of skills and experience are needed. You don't need to know how to program or  be a designer. What’s important is that you bring enthusiasm and a little time to work on the next idea, and to participate in the regular meetings.
