            <p>
                Boris Hekele, born 1978, studied Philosophie and Media Technology and has dealt with web technologies as early as 1998. Ever since he plans detailed web applications and works on new possibilities to involve citizens in the decision-making process. In 2004 he founded abgeordnentenwatch.de, which has won several prizes since. He is an advocate of Open Source and Open Data. Since December 2015 he is part of the core team of the broad coalition »Volksentscheid Fahrrad«, which aims to achieve a change in traffic policy in Berlin. In this context he founded the Civic Tech platform »FixMyBerlin«, which advocates a more transparent bicycle traffic planning for all Berliners and is supported by the Prototype Fund.
