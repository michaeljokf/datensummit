                <p>Are you a software developer or designer eager to use your skills to improve your neighborhood, city, or environment? Do you know people that would be interested in participating? Then write us an <a href="mailto:info@codefor.de">email</a>, so that we can support you.<br>
                You could also visit a lab in your neighborhood and pitch some new ideas or support existing projects. If there isn’t a lab near you, you could also participate remotely. The best approach would be to browse through current projects in different labs. Please get in touch with the individual labs running projects that may interest you. All projects are on Github and pull requests are highly welcome! There are also completed applications waiting to be implemented in other cities.</p>

                <p>Not a techie? No problem! We are not solely focussed on developing and designing applications, we also want people to use them and to spread the word. This is how we contribute to the debate on open data. Therefore, it’s important to us to be inclusive and as interdisciplinary as possible. In short, we are also looking for people interested in storytelling and public relations, as well as community building. Has this peaked your interest? If so, contact a lab near you!</p>
