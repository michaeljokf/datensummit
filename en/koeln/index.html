Welcome to the OK Lab Cologne! Our meetings take place every two weeks. Swing by one of our next meetups! At the moment we are working on a fine dust measuring device for mobile measurements, a local district dating app to find a place to live and a children's playground information app for Cologne's schools and students.

Of course, there are also projects that cannot be realized in the short term, such as the disclosure of the public transport timetable. An app that shows the defibrillator in one's vicinity is ready. Also, the Wasserqualit√§tsApp from Heilbronn (measuring the water quality) has been redeployed for Cologne. We welcome new faces who support us or bring their own ideas.
