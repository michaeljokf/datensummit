"Gude" and welcome to the OK Lab Frankfurt am Main!

We are a local group that is actively engaged in open data and civic hacking. We are figuring out how code and data can help our city in order to to make our neighborhoods and broader region nicer and better using digital tools. We share knowledge, open up public data, create visualizations and applications and publish analyses. To achieve this, we meet regularly.

Come on by! We welcome new faces who bring their own ideas or support us on existing projects. Code for Frankfurt am Main, Germany!
